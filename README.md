# DigiKeyMouserBarcodeScanner_GUI

Synopsis
------------------------------------------
A python GUI to retrieve information about electronic components using bag barcode.

Installation
-------
This is still an initial version and not a release.

To run:
* Have Python 2.7 installed
* pip install beautifulsoup4
* pip install tkinter

Run program the GUI by going to the correct directory and double-clicking on "GUI.py" or in Python CMD run:
python GUI.py

Motivation
----------------------------

At work I've been asked to catalog somewhere along the lines of 10,000 DigiKey bags in an effort to save money by buying parts we already have. With this system, we can avoid re-ordering parts we have in stock.

I hope this serves you well. This is my first real code release to the public so if you like it, I'd love to hear.

Please also note that as DigiKey updates the HTML, specifically the ID tags of their website, this program will need updateing.


Tests
---------------------------------

There are no tests currently Written.
