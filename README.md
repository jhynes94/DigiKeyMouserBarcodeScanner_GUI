# DigiKeyMouserBarcodeScanner_GUI

Synopsis
------------------------------------------
A python GUI to retrieve information about electronic components using bag barcode.

Installation
-------
This is still an initial version and not a release.

* Have Python 2.7 installed
* pip install beautifulsoup4
* pip install tkinter

Run program DigiGUI by going to the correct directory and in Python CMD run:
python DigiGUI.py

Later Directions will be posted

Motivation
----------------------------

At worked I've been asked to catalog somewhere along the lines of 10,000 DigiKey bags in an attempt to save money. If anything time spent cataloging will most definitely add up to more money that the project is worth, however writing this code and making the job easier for later employees is far better than spending my time than actually scanning the codes. Thus here I am writing the code.

I hope this serves you well. This is my first real code release to the public so if you like it, I'd love to hear. If you have any questions Please feel free to reach me at jbruell94@gmail.com


Tests
---------------------------------

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
